              Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
              It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
              making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
              professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
              the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
              passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
              literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
              from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et (The
              Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book
              is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
              Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit
              amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            <Paragraph className={styles.description}>
              The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
              reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
              1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorumby Cicero are also
              reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
              versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
